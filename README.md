Job Posting:
# Lead JavaScript Developer (male/female)
or call it whatever suits you. Just fork the Repo with your suggestions!

### Context:
némata is yet another one of those super-innovative Berlin web agencies. We’ve been going for some years now, and there are currently five of us hanging out in our very laid back Berlin office. Like any other agency or startup we only drink quality coffee and our Club Mate stocks will last at least another season. But sometimes we get stuff done, and we have fun doing it. We like our clients (mostly) and respect each other frequently. When we work, our focus is always on building great products.
What we do: we conceive and code creative technology projects for film productions, ad agencies, startups, and established brands. We operate within and between the realms of Creativity, Technology, Moving Images and Social Media [easy megapoints for bullshit bingo buzzwords, but nevertheless, true].


### Responsibilities
 * You will lead the team of programmers (staff & freelance) and the technical project management
 * You will design and develop awesome software solutions
 * You will write code that all your peers will admire
 * You are expected to wear nerdy t-shirts and kill 1l of Club Mate per day
 * You can, regularly, choose a topic and talk shop about it (so we can all learn)
 * Bonus points for a highscore in bullshit bingo or #winning Hackathons
 * New responsibilities everyday!

### Requirements
 * You’ve lost your “work in a creative group/startup virginity” recently
 * In other words, you have 42 years of experience (that we don’t care that much about), as well as a fresh young appearance (important)
 * You have experience in managing and building up teams between 2 and 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 members
 * You have profound knowledge in JavaScript / CoffeScript / Chaplin.js / AngularJS / node.js / Express,  MVC, OOP, API Design, HTML5, CSS3, SQL / NoSQL, responsive design
 * Written and spoken language proficiency in German, English, Farsi, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Swedish, Japanese, Hindi, Finnisch and Hungarian (Latin and Acient Greek are advantageous)
 * You bring along innovation skills, flexibility, mobility, and a young spirit as well as good looks under pressure, trustworthiness, a sense of responsibility, discipline, and conscientiousness.  Really – all of that.
 * You hold keynotes at TED and JSConf on a regular basis
 * You require no more than two hours of sleep each night without it impacting your good mood and, under pressure, you can code for up to 1 week without a break.

### Salary
 * Based on experience & abilities, but competitive for Berlin full time development employment with unlimited Club Mate & espresso baked into the contract. Which would be 10 Euro per year – if you don’t fork it ;-)


### Miscellaneous
 * Your place of work will be Berlin, Germany
 * You will be granted 0 vacation days – you know the drill ;-)
 * Clock-in is at 10:30 AM. 

### Interested?
